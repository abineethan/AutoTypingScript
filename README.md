# AutoTyper - Keyboard Automation Script

A Python script that simulates human typing behavior with customizable speed, formatting, and repetition options.

## Features

* Types any given text with adjustable character delay
* Supports two output formats:

  * **Newline-separated** (each repetition on a new line)
  * **Continuous text** (all repetitions concatenated)
* Customizable repetition count
* Proper handling of:

  * Uppercase letters (using **Shift** key)
  * Special characters (**Enter**, **Space**, **Tab**)
  * Emojis and Unicode characters (via clipboard)
* Progress tracking during typing
* Countdown before execution begins

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Required packages:

  ```bash
  pip install keyboard pyperclip
  ```
